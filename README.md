# Appcelerator Titanium Mobile with a tap detecting window.

This project is a modification of the [Titanium framework](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile)
v3.0.2.GA to enable touch events over a webview. Now it's possible to attach touch events to a web 
view without blocking the interaction with the web view. 

The code was adapted based on the article of [MITHIN KUMAR](http://mithin.in/2009/08/26/detecting-taps-and-events-on-uiwebview-the-right-way).
