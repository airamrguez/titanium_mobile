Make all Type constructors take the same arguments
Convert ObjectType.call methods in protos to ObjectPrototypeType calls and remove redundant method calls
Check to make sure all objects inheriting from FunctionTypeBase call it as their constructor, not ObjectType
Even out the event quote conventions around parameters
Normalize the ObjectType and FunctionTypeBase constructor calls (and others?)

Create list of all times that unknown values are created
